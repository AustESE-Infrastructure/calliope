Lyrics.
I Would Get Me a New Love.
I would get me a new love, the old fire is out!
I would get me a new love ere Spring comes about;
That as in her warm arms the fields all re-bloom,
My lone heart may awaken from coldness and gloom.
O there's nothing in nature like love when 'tis new;
And there's nothing in fortune like love when 'tis true!
But my passion for Meg was a fire that's burnt out,
And I'd get me a new love ere Spring comes about.
I would get me a new love, less Custom's cold slave;
And I'd get me a new love more earnest and brave!
To pure to mistrust me, too noble to doubt—
I would get such a new love ere Spring comes about.
But if such a new love I nowhere may get,
I'd as lief be thus lonely—nay, lonelier yet!
Than have one like the old love, just playing a part,
With a flare in her fancy, but ice at her heart.
Final copy.
