LOVE

O love is -- passing sweet,
When 'tis ours -- indeed to meet
With a golden--hearted Maid,
Nothing loth, -- and not afraid
To indrink its Orphic fire,
Till her whole soul, like a lyre,
Thrill and beat
To the thought, and with the feeling,—
Love is sweet.

'Tis like a sunset sky
Blushing beauty, to the eye;
It is like a summer wind
Breathing odors, to the mind;
It is like the fervent roll
Of rich music to the soul;
And we cry
Let us always love, or failing,—
Let us die!
