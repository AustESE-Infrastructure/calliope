Poetry.
Rising and setting suns of Liberty;
Mountainous èxploits, and the wrecks thick strewn
By stormy Passion o'er life's treacherous sea,
Relieved with shores of green delight, and boon
And starry dreams, and the serene pale moon
Of pathos;—these, with all of which they be
Idealisms, are of Poetry
The bodily temple, when to fitness hewn.
And for its soul:—all that the mind can sieze
Of beauty, harmonising with the might
Of natural ties and social sympathies,
And that deep spirit of pity whose flight
Is strongest, and most heavenward, 'mid the blight
Of mortal misery;—its Soul are these.
