Song.
From the German of Schiller.

The oak forest bellows, the clouds gather o'er;
To and fro walks the Maid on the green of the shore.
The wave is upbreaking with might, with might,
And she sings out into the desolate night;
With weeping her eyes are discoloured—and oh,
Her song is the very wild Spirit of Woe!

"The wide world is empty, the heart can not live,
And this life nothing further worth wishing can give!
Call home, thou Holy One!—home call thy Child,
Home from the earth now so wofully wild!
I have wearied my soul with its happiest pain;
I have lived, I have loved,—and what more can remain?"
